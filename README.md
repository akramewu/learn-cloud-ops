| Week   | Focus Area                    | Key Deliverable / Mini-Project                                                |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Terraform Basics + EC2        | Launch EC2 instance with user_data automation (done ✅)                        |
| **2**  | VPC Networking                | Multi-AZ VPC with IGW, NAT, Subnets, Route Tables (done ✅)                    |
| **3**  | Load Balancing & HA           | ALB + Auto Scaling Group across private subnets                               |

| **5**  | Storage & Databases           | S3, DynamoDB (or RDS) with Terraform, lifecycle rules                         |
| **6**  | CI/CD with Terraform          | Use GitHub Actions / Jenkins to deploy Terraform automatically                |
| **7**  | Kubernetes on AWS (EKS)       | Provision EKS cluster + node groups with Terraform                            |
| **8**  | Containers & ECS              | Deploy a containerized app on ECS Fargate or EC2 launch type                  |
| **9**  | Monitoring & Logging          | CloudWatch metrics, alarms, log groups, Terraform integration                 |
| **10** | Secrets & Networking Security | Systems Manager Parameter Store, KMS, security groups, NACLs                  |
| **11** | Multi-Cloud / Advanced IaC    | Add Azure or GCP Terraform providers; build a hybrid demo                     |
| **12** | Final Capstone Project        | Full 3-tier web app with CI/CD, VPC, EKS/ECS, monitoring, and README showcase |
