# Understanding AWS Route Tables and Route Table Associations

To understand route tables and route table associations, think of them like a postal service:

* **Route Table: The Map**
    * A route table is like a map that tells network traffic where to go. It contains a set of rules, called routes, that determine how data packets are directed between different networks.
    * These "routes" define which destination IP addresses should be sent to which "target" (like an internet gateway, or another network).
    * Essentially, it's the rule book for how traffic moves.

* **Route Table Association: The Address Label**
    * A route table association is like an address label that sticks a particular map (route table) to a specific area (subnet).
    * It's the link that connects a route table to a subnet, an internet gateway, or a virtual private gateway.
    * This association ensures that traffic within that specific subnet follows the rules defined in the associated route table.
    * In other words, the association is what makes the map, have effect on the specific location.

**In simpler terms:**

* The route table says "if the letter is going to this address, send it this way."
* The route table association says "all letters from this house (subnet) should use this particular set of directions (route table)."

Therefore:

* You need a route table to define the rules for your network traffic.
* You need a route table association to apply those rules to specific parts of your network.
